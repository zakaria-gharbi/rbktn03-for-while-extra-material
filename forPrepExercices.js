// Basic Requirments
// 0.Try to write all of the exercises using both the for loop and while loop.

// 1.Write a function sum that computes the sum of the numbers in an array.

// 2.Write a function max that accepts an array of numbers and returns the largest number in the array.

// 3.Try the following at a console:

//  'the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog'.split(' ');
//  'Hello, world!'.split('')
//  '1,2,3,4,5,6'.split(',')
// What is returned by split (You can read more about it here (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split) and how does it work?
//  Use split to write a function longestWord that takes a string as an argument and returns the longest word.
// 4.Write a function remove that accepts an array and an element, and returns an array with all ocurrences of element removed.

// function remove(array, element) {
//  // your code here
//  }
//  remove([1, 3, 6, 2, 3], 3); // => [1, 6, 2]
// 5.Write a function evens that accepts an array as an argument, and returns an array consisting of all of the even numbers in that array.

// More Practice
// 1.Write a function called average that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the average of those numbers.

// 2. Write a function called min that finds the smallest number in an array of numbers.

// 3.Write a function shortestWord that works like longestWord, but returns the shortest word instead.

// 4.Write a function countChar that takes two arguments: any string, and a character (string of one letter), and returns the number of times that the character occurs in the string.

// 5.Write a function evenLengthWords that takes an array of strings as an argument, and returns an array of just the words that have an even length.

// Advanced
// 1.Read about the join method on MDN and use it to implement a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns that string reversed

// 2.Write a function keep that 'keeps' certain elements in an array. The function will need to take two arguments, an array, and something else -- the second argument will be what is used to determine which elements to keep.

// You should be able to use this function to write evens, evenLengthWords, a hypothetical odds function, or oddLengthWords without changing the keep function.
